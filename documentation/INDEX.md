# Shapeships Documentation

This repository uses **contracts-first documentation**.

## Structure

### `/contracts/`
Normative, binding architectural rules.

- [**canonical-handoff.md**](contracts/canonical-handoff.md) — The authoritative architectural constitution. If anything conflicts with this document, this document wins.

### `/howto/`
Operational guidance for development workflows.

Currently empty. Guides will be added as needed.

### `/reference/`
Lookup material for technical details.

Currently empty. References will be added as needed.

## Explicit Policy

**Status updates, migration summaries, and implementation plans do not belong in documentation.**

Git history is the archive.

This documentation directory contains only current, binding, non-temporal information required to maintain architectural integrity.
