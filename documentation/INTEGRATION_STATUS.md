This status report is now superseded by `/documentation/OPTION_B_FINAL_STATUS.md` which provides the current implementation status.

**Key Update:** We've completed Phase 1 (pure data layer creation) and documented Phase 2 requirements. The temporary server implementation has proper safeguards in place.

See:
- `/documentation/OPTION_B_FINAL_STATUS.md` - Current status
- `/documentation/QUICK_REF_COMPLETE_DELEGATION.md` - Next steps guide
- `/documentation/PHASE_2_BLOCKED_STATUS.md` - Blocker details
